# Facebook Crap Remover

Chrome extension to hide unwanted posts based on keywords from your news feed.

2. Open the Extension Management page by navigating to chrome://extensions.
3. Enable Developer Mode by clicking the toggle switch next to Developer mode.
4. Click the LOAD UNPACKED button and select the unzipped extension directory.

## How to Use

1. Right click on extension icon in the main Google Chrome toolbar, to the right of the address bar.
2. Select "Options"
3. Write the keywords you want to block as comma separated value. Save.
4. Refresh your news feed. Crap gone.
